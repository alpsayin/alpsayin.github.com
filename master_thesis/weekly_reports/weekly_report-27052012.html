<b>Notes:</b><br>
Project plan is written, all the solutions and tasks are well explained. There might not be enough time to complete all the tasks before July. So, an extension might be necessary. Prioritization of the solutions are pending.<br>
<br>
Radiotftp port for Atmega128 w/Contiki is progressing well, although it needs optimization due to high stack usage. Apparenly Contiki-Os has utilities for manchester encoding. Using this code is considered. Progress and source code is updated to the Google Code Repository<br>
