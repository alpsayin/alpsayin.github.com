<b>Notes:</b><br>
While porting radiotftp to Atmega128 some problems occurred related with powering the board and baud rate settings. Although both problems are solved, they caused some delay in the progress. At first the problem seemed permanent, therefore a "beacon" mode for radiotftp is developed. Which is sending out data in a single packet without expecting any acknowledgments (much like the APRS protocol actually). It was tested and verified. But, in the meantime the main problem is also solved so the main task had to be restarted from the beginning(main task: porting of radiotftp client functions to Atmega128).
