<b>Notes:</b><br>
While testing radiotftp_process, found a few bugs both in radiotftp_process and radiotftp(the sources are linked, so this only natural). Those bugs were minor bugs, so it was trivial to fix them. Also this week, with Bjorn we also verified the soundmodem solution again both with handheld radios and Yaesu radios. We also built aprx for Voyage Linux and tested it as Aprs Rx-Igate. Works fine, I am still waiting news from Bjorn about full digipeater function.
